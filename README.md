# Hi there, I'm Gavin! 👋

I'm currently working my way through a **JavaScript Full-stack bootcamp**, building up my coding muscles one project at a time. I've also dipped my toes into **Python**, and I'm excited to see where these skills take me.

## What I'm About

I'm drawn to projects that blend technology with creativity. My interests span **art, design, fashion, music, and books** — basically anything that makes me curious, from Einstein's theories to the evolution of the Holy Grail myth. I love the idea of building things that sit at the intersection of these worlds.
